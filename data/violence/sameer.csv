Jo haal dil ka
is a very strange song. Its strange only in the context in which it is presented. After all, heroines in wet, clingy clothes, mouthing sensual songs near waterfalls and other convenient water features is hardly strange for a Hindi film; Its par for the course, but this song has no attempt at a gentle segue into moistness, or an excuse, such a swimming, bathing, picnics or whatever. This one jumps right in, and the hero is soaking wet throughout the song too. But mostly its strange because it is the one tangent from cinema reality into complete fantasy in an otherwise straight-edged film.
Sarfarosh
was hardly the epitome of realism, but for the most part t was set in a heightened and stylised real world. Its quite an effective crime thriller.

Dr. Sheth specializes in the treatment of patients with Movement Disorders, Epilepsy, Brain Tumors, Trigeminal Neuralgia, Hydrocephalus, and certain Psychiatric Disorders. He enjoys bringing a personalized approach to each patient in order to arrive at an individually tailored treatment plan optimized for the patient and his or her family. He works with a world-class multi-disciplinary team of surgeons, neurologists, psychiatrists, radiologists, and others to provide compassionate, state-of-the-art care for his patients. Among the many techniques at his disposal are stereotactic neurosurgery, deep brain stimulation, ablative techniques, awake brain mapping, electrode recordings, computer-guided navigation, and microsurgery. Dr. Sheth is also a neuroscientist, with PhD and post-doctoral training in neurophysiology. His research interests are centered on a desire to better understand brain function. Dr. Sheths research is motivated by the belief that if we can understand how the brain works at the level of individual neurons and circuits, we will be much better equipped to repair it.

In 2010 while visiting his parents here in Qatar, Canadian Sameer Ali realized something was terribly wrong. A short flight to his native India and a few tests after, the unexpected was confirmed - he had been diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma. After chemotherapy and a 6 month stay, he was free of cancer and back to Canada, only to learn his cancer had returned. Fast forward to 2016, and a few mountains later, Sameer is a true testament to how a positive attitude can overcome anything.
Follow him on his journey as he raises cancer awareness, one mountain at a time.

Tracking down a variety of difficult sources for my trend story. Seeking to look closer at at the contrast between player power in the NFL and NBA, I was able to get in touch with prominent agents from both leagues and speak with them at length, which was fulfilling in itself.
What is your proudest personal achievement at cherubs?
My ability to make strong connections with several people in a small amount of time. These friendships are unique in that they are with people who share my passion for writing and journalism. The bonds Ive formed will hopefully last.

Sameer ShibliSameer Patil, Investor, Bellevue, WA - BiggerPockets Profile.Sameer Hinduja, Ph.D., study author, a professor in the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice within FAU's College for Design and Social Inquiry, and co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center.Not provided.An academic course presents an opportunity for all participants to collaborate for improving their knowledge.  This collective improvement of knowledge is typically documented via material provided by the instructor and notes and assignments prepared by students.  Over the course of a semester, these materials provide not only the collective knowledge in that course, but also provide a chronological history of how the knowledge base evolved. The focus of this study is wiki collaboration in teaching & learning contexts.   A wiki is a medium in which a group of individuals can work together asynchronously on an idea and easily capture the essence in a reusable format.  Technically, a wiki is a collection of hyperlinked Web pages that are assembled with wiki software.   With wikis, the line between reader and contributor is intentionally blurred.  Further, wiki use reflects the view of an instructor as one who facilitates information sharing among learners rather than simply transmitting knowledge from themselves to their students.    Our initial motivation to explore the usefulness of wikis for teaching and learning was driven by the fact that wikis provide a medium in which several individuals could asynchronously work together on an idea and easily capture the essence in a reusable format.   We found that: (1) Wikis can be can be used for a variety of tasks ranging from signup sheet for students to self organize, to undertaking business analyses, to analyzing policy positions; (2) Instructor support and facilitation is key; and (3) Ease-of-use issues are present but do not preclude success.Contact

Can Social Navigation Inform Interpersonal Privacy Preferences?

Abstract
Sameer Patil
Indiana University
Recent privacy controversies surrounding social networking systems like Facebook and Google Buzz demonstrate that the mere *availability* of privacy settings is not enough for effective privacy management. We investigated whether the aggregated privacy choices of one's social circle might guide users in making informed privacy decisions. We conducted an experiment in which users specified preferences for six privacy-relevant settings in Instant Messaging. In one condition, users were provided with information indicating the privacy preferences of the majority of their "buddies." Based on the experiment data and accompanying user comments, we suggest several usability improvements in interfaces for specifying privacy preferences.

Before we get to the duets, we hear from one of my favorite JMac albums Demon's Dance. That is followed by two sax players with Connecticut roots. Nick Biello and Noah Preminger. Both have new recordings, Biello his premier, and Preminger with plenty. Then the duets: Preminger/Carlberg, Cohen/Hersch, Haden/Metheny. Salim Washington is back, and Sameer Gupta gives us Indian/Jazz fusion.
