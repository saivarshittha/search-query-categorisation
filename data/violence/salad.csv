You know, Ive always liked salads, but thought they were too healthy for my lifestyle. How can I make a salad unhealthy for me?
The usual answer, of course, is the taco salad. Its a salad in a big flour-based bowl, but topped with the contents of about 6 tacos worth of meat and cheese and such. But is that really enough? Is that really unhealthy enough for my inactive lifestyle?
Of course not. Enter: Bacon Cups.
Yes, a cup made of bacon. What better thing could you possibly make edible utensils out of than bacon?

Last week I was out with friends watching a movie in the park. After a group decision, we headed down to a dive bar to grab a beer and hang out for a bit after. At the movie in the park event we had three food trucks. One was Thai food and the other was sea food. I remember thinking these has to both be high risk food trucks. Never the less, my adventurous spirit seemed to push through any fears. I had Lobster tacos, Clam Chowder, and some Pho Thai noodles. It was all really good and I felt fine, my lucky day. Shortly after arriving to the dive bar, I started feeling queasy and walked outside for some fresh air. Within minutes, my vision went blurry and and my balance was gone. Wobbling over to a place to sit down my wonderful date so kindly helped me get away from people and take a minute in the rest room. Luckily after about five minutes or so there I was feeling much better. I was sure one of those food trucks did me in and blamed them the whole way home in our ride share.

Juice 1 x lemon
Method:
This recipe is super easy if you have a food processor with a grating function. If not, youre going to need strong arm muscles and a cheese grater as you need to grate all of the carrot and courgette before putting into a large bowl.
Next, chop up the dill and mix into the courgette and carrot.
Pour the freshly squeezed lemon juice over the veg whilst stirring. You can add black pepper to taste.
Super easy!
Ingredients:
1 x block firm silken tofu (I used Mori-nu 394g pack)
1 x jar (185g) vegan friendly pesto (or you can make your own if you have time!)
 x tsp salt
 x tsp black pepper
1 x tsp garlic powder
 x cup soya milk (or any dairy replacement).
2 x tbsp. nutritional yeast
Method:
Put the tofu, pesto, salt, pepper, garlic powder and milk into a blender. Blend until smooth.
The sauce will taste a bit beany so next step is to transfer into a small saucepan and heat whilst stirring (a silicon spatula is perfect for this).
Once the dressing begins to bubble*, take off the heat and add the nutritional yeast. You will have to stir fairly vigorously to make sure its mixed in well with no lumps.
*Please take care because the sauce has a tendency to spit!
Allow to cool and serve over your salad.
I combined my salad and dressing with some roasted baby hasselback potatoes and some chili and coriander beans. Satisfying, healthy, cruelty free and importantly,  delicious!

How much should a salad cost? $5? $10? $100? Should is a dangerous game to play. Free-market economists would tell you that salads should cost as much as the market is willing to pay. At Terminal 4 in LAX, Campanile is charging $18 for a salad (plus tax) and the market seems prepared to payTags

Making the perfect salad is slightly more complicated than throwing lettuce in a bowl and calling it a day. But its not so complicated as to justify buying a premade salad at the grocery store or always going out to eat a salad. There are no steadfast rules to salad-making, but these guidelines will make your salad something you look forward to (like taking an IntroSem) rather than something mandatory and boring (Thinking Matters).

For this bright and refreshing citrus salad, chef Eddie Hernandez of Taqueria del Sol uses an 80/20 blend of vegetable oil to olive oil.

My sauce for the summer is this one: Basil Vinaigrette. Dont get me wrong, I love pesto. But this basil-forward sauce has the punchy flavor of fresh herbs but takes less than a minute to blend together. And unlike its thicker cousin, this vinaigrette can be drizzled over everything, from fresh tomatoes and shelling beans, to risotto or roasted potatoes, and even fresh cheese, like burrata.

July 31, 2017
This traditional chicken salad recipe is lightened up with Greek nonfat yogurt and creamy mashed avocado for an added boost of protein plus good for you fats that make this salad so tasty no one will ever miss the mayo.
This post is in partnership with Oikos Greek Nonfat Yogurt who has compensated me to create a recipe using their product. All opinions are my own.
Continuing with tradition is so good in so many ways. But continuing to evolve is even better.
I mean, why use the answering machine when you have voice mail at your fingertips instead? And why tool your baby around in an old-fashioned pram instead of an easy-to-transport collapsible baby stroller? And just think of what wed all sound like if language didnt change over time If your great umbrage would care to meet my high dudgeon at 12 paces, I would be happy to entertain you at dawn.
Huh?
So while this chicken salad has a whole lot of the classic flavors (shredded chicken, grapes, celery, pecans, red onion) it has also taken a turn for the healthy by subbing in mashed avocado mixed with
in place of the typical mayonnaise binder.
This change is good, and good for you, friends.
