On 6pm, youll find brand-name products at deep discounts. For instance, there was a $1400.00 GPS system available during the snafu for only $49.95 during the six hours of the pricing problem. The issue was discovered  and corrected  by 6am PST that morning. The company states that it will honor all purchases made during that time at the prices which were advertised. The cost of the messup for them is estimated at $1.6 million.
Sister site Zappos uses customer service as their key component of sales. It has paid off well, as its considered to be the biggest online shoe store on the Internet with over a billion dollars worth of sales in the past year. It was acquired by Amazon last year.
