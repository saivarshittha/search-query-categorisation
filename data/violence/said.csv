PORT SAID
Port Said is a port city in northeastern Egypt at the mouth of the Suez Canal in the Mediterranean Sea.
The basis of Port Saids economy is fishing and the chemical, food and snuff-box industries. In addition to being a refueling station for ships crossing the canal, it is from Port Said that a large part of Egyptian production is exported, such as cotton and rice. But Port Said is also a free zone and a summer resort for many Egyptians.
There are many old houses with large balconies on each floor. On the eastern shore of the canal is Port-Fouad, which can be reached by ferry. About forty kilometers to the south, the El Qantara bridge allows the passage from one bank to the other.

The farmer is the only man in our economy who buys everything at retail, sells everything at wholesale, and pays the freight both ways.
President John F. Kennedy
I know of no pursuit in which more real and important services can be rendered to any country than by improving its agriculture, its breed of useful animals, and other branches of a husbandmans cares.
President George Washington
Agricultureis our wisest pursuit, because it will in the end contribute most to real wealth, good morals, and happiness.
President Thomas Jefferson

President Abraham Lincoln

William Jennings Bryan
Whoever makes two ears of corn, or two blades of grass to grow where only one grew before, deserves better of mankind, and does more essential service to his country than the whole race of politicians put together.

And step toward its body laced with crime
To analyze the what, how, when and why.
It looks quite innocent from where I am,
A figure cloaked in camphor-scented lies,
So I get closer till the fog of glamor
Lifts, revealing all my tongue devised.
Its face glows bright, a blinding flaring red,
Its hands are raised, upturned without a care,
I look for smile but find a smirk instead,
And cringe to see the maggots in its hair.
I let time roll to crush its nasty head
And plan apologies for what I said.

And I got an excellent freaking review about how
Mayan Abdominal massage helped GERD
which I hadnt really considered as something that could be helped by this modality but dude for reals this is awesome.
The night of the massage, I rested and ate light. I expected this to be a process that might take many weeks; but I woke the next morning hungry for the first time in a year! The next week, I continued to improve, but was again in distress when I saw her for the second time three weeks later.
Now also armed with self-care instructions provided by Rowan, I had even better and longer lasting results, and began to notice a significant improvement in my stomach symptoms. At the third session it became very obvious to me that these massage techniques may help common gastro-intestinal problems such as irregularity and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as GERD, heartburn and bloating.

The Idea:
This is like the reverse version of The Newlywed Game, where the guests are put to the test!
Ground work:
Before the shower, ask the couple to answer questions about their love story (how they met, their first date, the vacations theyve taken together). Make a list of their answers, and mix up the responses so theres no way to know who said what. Take out any names or pronouns that would make it obvious who said what, like The first thing that attracted me was (his/her) smile. Finally, print out copies of the list of quotes for all the guests.
How to Play:
Pass out the list of quotes to each guest and have them draw a circle around the ones they think the guest of honor said.
