A safe is usually a hollow cuboid or cylinder, with one face being removable or hinged to form a door. The body and door may be cast from metal (such as steel) or formed out of plastic through blow molding. Bank teller safes typically are secured to the counter, have a slit opening for dropping valuables into the safe without opening it, and a time-delay combination lock to foil robbers/and or thieves. One significant distinction between types of safes is whether the safe is secured to a wall or structure or if it can be moved around. A less secure version (only suitable for petty cash) is usually called a cash-box.Secure Data and Manage Cybersecurity Risks

Jan.  8 at 9:32 a.m.
USPS wants employees to take extra precautions when driving this winter.
The Postal Service is reminding employees to drive safely during the winter, a time of year that presents unique challenges.
Here are some tips:
 Allow yourself extra time to stop and turn.
Slow down well in advance of traffic lights, traffic signs and intersections.
 Leave extra space between your vehicle and other traffic.
Reduce speed and increase the following distance between you and the vehicle in front of you.
 If you have to stop because of unsafe conditions, pull off the road.
Get well away from traffic lanes.
 Rehearse winter driving in an empty parking lot.
Make your vehicle slide and skid, and practice correcting these maneuvers. Learn to stop and turn without losing control on snow and ice.
 Ensure all windows and mirrors are free of snow.
Make sure your vehicle has enough washer fluid, too.
 Scan the road ahead.
If theres decreased visibility due to high snowbanks, other drivers will be forced to pull their vehicles out further into the line of traffic to see. Be prepared to act by reducing your speed

The MoCA provides scoring 0-30. Originall developed for detection of mild cognitive impairment, the MoCA provides specific information about cognitive domains such as executive function, memory/delayed recall, attention, language and orientation. In our experience the MoCA is more sensitive to detect significant cognitive impairments than other screens such as the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE).

Safe Access to Fuel and Energy (SAFE) Initiative
To achieve Zero Hunger, the delivery of food assistance must take into account the numerous safety, health, economic and environmental challenges associated with properly cooking it.
Every day
, millions of women and children face serious risks trying to obtain the fuel they need to prepare, process and preserve their food
. In humanitarian settings where resources are scarce, this means many women and girls have to travel long distances to collect firewood, exposing themselves to the
risk of attacks and sexual violence
. Pressure on shared natural resources also causes
tensions between displaced people and host communities.
Every year,
4.3 million people die from health problems related to exposure to smoke from solid fuel cook stoves
. Women and children are especially susceptible to the
harmful consequences of indoor pollution
as they are the ones who spend the most time near the cooking area. Vulnerable populations often sell food to buy fuel or undercook their food to save on fuel costs, thus
jeopardising their nutrition.
Much locally-produced food is also lost due to a lack of access to energy solutions to process and preserve it, including drying and chilling.
Dependence on firewood and charcoal to prepare meals also puts considerable
pressure on the environmentBrowse all artworks with the Safe tag on Artsy.

At home, be careful with candles and decorations. Thousands of deaths are caused by fires, burns and other fire-related injuries every year, according to the National Safety Council. Fires started by candles are a prime cause, reports the National Fire Protection Association. Each December, increased use of candles and fireplaces  combined with lots of combustible, seasonal decorations  puts many homes at risk for dangerous fires.

Before buying the safe, you need to consider your main reason for buying it.
Before buying
home safes
, the potential buyer needs to be clear about what they need, and are trying to protect; in order to purchase the correct safe.
Safes are generally designed to perform a specific task. Some are designed to protect documents in the event of a fire. These are known as fire resistant safes, and are designed to keep papers inside them from igniting.
Others are designed as burglar resistant types. These are designed to make entry into it as difficult as possible. The longer it takes to enter the safe, the more likelihood of the burglar being caught.
They can generally be mounted into both walls and the floor. Those mounted in to the floor are often used specifically for burglar resistance. Both fire resistant and burglar resistant ones are mounted into walls.
The biggest difference in home safe design for most users, will be the opening mechanism. Traditional manual ones use a key to gain access. These keys need to be carried around, and can be lost or stolen.
Combination locks can be found in two varieties. Rotary dial combination locks use a dial, which is rotated in a set pattern, to unlock the mechanism. Electronic types, still use a combination, however the combination is entered by an electronic keypad.
Digital safes, use geo-location as an additional security feature. In the event that the safe itself is stolen, to be opened at a later time by the burglar, the geo-location technology is able to track the location of this kind, to within less than a metre.

for her quick thinking and for speaking up after managing to escape from her alleged kidnapper last week.
Calysta Cordova was reported missing Thursday afternoon by her mother when she didnt come home from school. Authorities believed she was abducted on her walk home and issued an Amber Alert. Calysta was found safe Friday at the Circle K convenience store in Colorado Springs, according to ABC News Denver affiliate KMGH.
Colorado Springs police spokeswoman Barbara Miller told KMGH that authorities believe Calysta was in a car with 29-year-old suspect Jose Garcia when the car broke down. A passerby picked them up and drove them to the Circle K convenience store, police said. There, Calysta ran into the store and asked for a phone, saying she wanted to call her uncle. Instead, she called 911.
She had two black eyes, bruises on her cheek, witness Efrin Villapondo told KMGH. She was in bad shape. The bruise on her face was enormous. When Garcia entered the store, Calysta defiantly refused to go anywhere with him. She looked at me, pointed into my eyes and just said, I aint going nowhere. Im waiting right here for my momma. I looked at the guy, he looked at me, into my eyes, spun around and just high-tailed it out of there, said Villapondo.
Garcia took off on foot before police arrived. Calysta was transported to Memorial Hospital to be treated for her injuries. Garcia was found at a bus stop in downtown Colorado Springs, about 7.5 miles south of the convenience store where they had been dropped off.

We understand sometimes you just need to get home. So we created a safety feature that will let you pay for taxis with no phone cash or card. If your phone is dead or your purse is MIA you can just hop in a Flag taxi and still get from A to B.

Heres how it works :
 Download Flag The Taxi App.
 Add your card details, an ID like photo and create a unique 4 digit pin in settings.
 Hop in a taxi and ask the driver to use Flag Pin Pay. Then enter your name and pin into the driver app, your photo appears which confirms your identity so our driver can take you safely from A to B.

Safety slogans are abundant. Many are also abundantly unclear and ineffective.
The picture to the right is a sign on the door handle of a service truck. It provides an excellent example of why safety slogans are ineffective. Each slogan also demonstrates how product designs can be updated to include important systems, making safety slogans unnecessary.
First, this slogan does nothing to identify or eliminate hazards. The wording maintain three points of contact with the vehicle can be eliminated by incorporating near object detection devices into the vehicle during the design.
Second, the wording always wear your seat belt is not necessary if you have a system which has a constant buzzing noise or perhaps ignition interlock which prevents the vehicle from starting until the seat belt is engaged.
Third, the wording turn off/put away all distractions is not necessary if you have a system that blocks the phone signal (absent an emergency) while the vehicle is in operation. Perhaps this system would not be popular with consumers. However, humans have very poor divided attention abilities.
Fourth, if the poorly thought out slogan is to be used on this service truck, why is it on the outside by the door handle and not the inside to provide a constant reminder to the driver?
So, what does be safe really mean? This is the problem with poorly thought out slogans. The slogans are subject to various interpretations.
Safety is not common sense. What is common to you may not be common to another person. Safety, a science that identifies hazards, risks, and safety engineering alternatives, cannot be addressed by vague safety slogans. Safety begins long before a product or system reaches consumers.

Is your facility secure? Sadly, in todays environment that is a question all building owners need to ask. Do you know what types of locks you have on your exit doors? Can they be secured from inside while still allowing for emergency exiting? Does your staff have a back way to exit your space? If not, is there a safe haven area where they can go and be secure from a threat (natural or not)?
How do you know? Where do you go to get answers?
There are several approaches that both designers and security personnel and first-responders use to evaluate an existing space and to design a new one. One of the most well-known is CPTED, or Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design. This is mostly used by civilian personnel and includes both indoor and outdoor spaces (you know those planters in front of most government buildings). Another, used by federal agencies, in particular, the Department of Defense is ATFP, or Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection.
It is not comfortable to have to face these issues, but it is imperative that we do.

Stay Safe
As you sit back and rest in the warmth of your fireplace, the condition of your chimney may well be the last thing on your mind. We know how it can be: you get home from a long day of work in one of those cold winter months, and nothing feels greater than that refreshing blaze giving off heat, light, and maybe a little joy. However, if your chimney is not properly maintained, that joy may be rather short-lived.
Chimneys keep you safe when working well. They carry out dangerous
fumes
and
toxins
from your fireplaces, wood stoves, and/or furnaces. As those fumes and toxins escape through the relatively cool chimney, they can condense leaving behind a residue that sticks to the walls of the chimney. This residue is called
creosote
: a highly combustible black or brown residue that can come in varying consistencies. As creosote builds up, it can restrict the airflow of the chimney which may allow dangerous fumes and toxins such as
carbon monoxide
back into your home, or worse, the creosote can ignite and start a chimney fire.
According to the
