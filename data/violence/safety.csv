Asbestos is a versatile fibrous mineral that can be cheaply mined and has unusual fire resistance and durability. Its use exploded in the twentieth century, when it was included in such diverse products as automobile brake linings, pipe insulation, ceiling and floor tiles, textured paints, concrete, mattresses, electric blankets, heaters, ironing boards and even piano felts.

I recently spoke with Andrew Rigie, Executive Vice President of the New York City chapter of the
New York State Restaurant Association
, in the hopes that he could shed some light on the situation.
Andrew, why has something that seems so simple turned out to be such a nightmare to navigate, for both diners and restaurateurs?
The biggest issue is that the letter grade system seems straightforward, yet it is based on a complex health code and the letter grade system is intellectually incoherent.
How so?
People feel that they understand what the letter grades really are. But, when I went to school, 90-100 percent on a test was an A, 80-90 percent was a B, and so on. What diners need to understand is that there are more than 1,000 points that a restaurant can accrue during an inspection, and it only takes 14 points to get a B and 28 points to get a C. If you use educational scoring here, 28 points is actually more than a 96%, which was an A+ when I went to school.
In reality, then, a C really *isnt* the bad or dangerous grade some diners perceive it to be?
Its important to recognize that a C-graded restaurant is deemed safe and sanitary enough to serve the public. If the restaurant was not safe to serve the public, the health department would shut it down.An official website of the United States government

NEC Helps Make Cities Safer
Safe Cities is an integral part of NECs vision for Smart Cities, where people are able to live, work, and play in safety and comfort while also coexisting in harmony with the environment. While safeguarding cities is challenging, NEC has advanced technologies and solutions that make this possible.

The many disasters around us  natural and manmade  are vivid reminders of how complex and unpredictable the world has become. With improved communications capabilities, citizens today are better informed and enabled to make demands on government to respond more quickly to any safety or security breach. While it is impossible to prevent all disruptions, it is possible to help to pre-empt or to prevent some of these incidents from taking place.
Cities in the Asia Pacific have different levels of capacity development, technologies readiness and implementation maturity. Yet, they have very similar underlying issues to contend with, and fortunately, the same access to information and knowledge. The challenge today is in translating information into action.
NEC has a proven track record in public safety. In biometric technologies alone, NEC has installed the worlds fastest and most accurate biometric identification systems for more than 480 customers in over 30 countries in areas such as national identification, law enforcement, e-passport, visa application and border control.

 Keep your fridge and freezer closed as much as possible. A full refrigerator will maintain safe temperatures for up to six to 10 hours; a full freezer up to 2 days. In most cases, food should be safe if refrigerators and freezers remain closed while the power is out. When in doubt, throw it out.
