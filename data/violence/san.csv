do not map well semantically, so these tags are not used locally.  Because of the relatively slow rendering process (hours or days, not minutes) of the wider zoom levels displayed by the Carto (Standard) layer, getting this tagging right and seeing its feedback will take some time, perhaps going into summer of 2017.  Thank you for your patience; I believe San Diego will both return Nominatim search results as well as render very nicely after this harmonization is complete.
Mapping Parties!
Mapping parties are community events targeted at getting a specific area mapped in a day or a weekend. You come along, are loaned a GPS unit and shown how to use it (it's easy!) and you go out mapping an area of your choosing. Then you come back and are shown how to get that data in to the map.
They are relaxed events and you're supposed to have fun. Often we grab a beer after the event.

The world of multi-tenant bare metal cloud computing in the datacenter is increasingly important.  With tenants being offered their own servers rather than locked-down VMs or compute services, the potential for innovation is much higher.  Mass Open Cloud aims to offer a multi-tenant cloud where hardware would be shared between organizations, such as universities, with tenants able to access bare metal instances directly. Heres how we propose to create a standardized architecture to provide a seamless elastic bare-metal experience for Mass Open Cloud and similar environments.

Great to sit down and chat with music director (and accomplished pianist) Aaron Prado and station manager Ryan Webber, surrounded by floor to ceiling vinyl.  We had a nice interview and they gave me a quick history of the San Antonio jazz scene.  Drummer Jerry Gibbs has led a modern jazz resurgence over the last few years, before leaving town.  They sent me off with a notebook full of recommendations for local music that evening.
Local music critic and rock bassist Steve Elliott filled out my knowledge of the local hard rock scene; Pitbull Daycare, Anger Kil, Lokey, Powderburn among his favorites.  Also pointed me to Hogwilds, the local indie store where I picked up as much of the local music as I could find.
The afternoon was a study in contrasts.  Mellow jazz set with Joan Carroll and Hanz Frommeyer and
Carmens de la Calle
, followed by an acoustic open mic run by songwriter/local music mentor Eric Geyer.  Met a bunch of his friends, already regular Pandora users.  Mary Kay second from right was there with her acoustic guitar for the open mic  shes using Pandora in her middle school class.
Before hitting the road, I finished the night off at the White Rabbit listening to Forgive Durkin from Seattle rip through a hard rock set  impressive band, loud as hell, but really intricate.  Got a good look at the San Antonio teenage thrash metal set They were the last of 8 bands on the bill.  Hard working groups  really deserve respect.
Headed out that night with a front seat full of CDs, ears still ringing.  All in all a great day.

, the fraudsters responsible for releasing the digital contagion are no doubt counting their earnings and congratulating themselves on a job well done. But according to a review of the Bitcoin addresses hard-coded into Wana, it appears the perpetrators of whats being called the worst ransomware outbreak ever have made little more than USD $26,000 so far from the scam.
Victims of the Wana ransomware will see this lock screen demanding a $300 ransom to unlock all encrypted files.
The Wana ransomware became a global epidemic virtually overnight this week, after criminals started distributing copies of the malware with the help of a security vulnerability in
Windows
computers that
Microsoft
patched in March 2017. Infected computers have all their documents and other important user files scrambled with strong encryption, and victims without access to good backups of that data have two choices: Kiss the data goodbye, or pay the ransom  the equivalent of approximately USD $300 worth of the virtual currency Bitcoin.
According to
on the Wana ransomware published Friday by security firm
Redsocks
, Wana contains three bitcoin payment addresses that are hard-coded into the malware. One of the nice things about Bitcoin is that anyone can view all of the historic transactions tied a given Bitcoin payment address. As a result, its possible to tell how much the criminals at the helm of this crimeware spree have made so far and how many victims have paid the ransom.
A review of the three payment addresses hardcoded into the Wana ransomware strain indicates that these accounts to date have received 100 payments totaling slightly more than 15 Bitcoins  or approximately $26,148 at the current Bitcoin-to-dollars exchange rate.See a full listing of local insurance agents and insurance agencies in San Francisco, California.
