by Elia El Khazen. On May 6th, citizens of Lebanon had the opportunity to vote in a general election for the first time in nine years. The timing of the 2018 parliamentary elections in Lebanon was no coincidence. It followed a near decade-long absence that saw parliament extend its own mandate by using security concerns as a justification for keeping the country under a de facto state of exception, allowing the ruling class to weather the Arab uprisings without any significant fragmentation of the historical bloc that has governed Lebanon for the last 14 years, while counter-revolutionary currents andanciensread moreSalvage may refer to:accident written off branding salvager/salvage:Useable furniture, housewares and appliances:

About the Author
Lois McMaster Bujold was born 2 November 1949 in Columbus, Ohio. She attended Ohio State University from 1968 to 1972, but didnt graduate. She describes her

She discovered fandom in 1969, and married fellow fan John Fredric Bujold in 1971 (now recently divorced); they have one son and one daughter.She started writing in 1982, and sold her first story to

Salvage selection
Certain items may have upgrade components attached that can be salvaged. These components can only be salvaged by using Expert, Superior, and Perfect Salvage Kits. When this is the case, a salvage component selection window appears, displaying all possible salvage components that can be salvaged from the item. The percentage chance of destroying the salvage item is shown for each salvage component. Select the desired salvage component and confirm it (or cancel it to stop the salvage process). The salvage process always successfully produces the salvage component; only the salvaged item has a chance of being destroyed in the process. An item can be salvaged more than once if it still has salvageable components remaining and is not destroyed during salvaging.
Salvaging for crafting materials

destroys the salvage item, as it translates to completely dismantling the item. You can't choose to salvage for rare crafting materials; rather, when salvaging using Expert or Superior Salvage Kits, there is a small chance of obtaining rare crafting materials

As decisionmakers in the U.S. Forest Service remain stricken by "analysis paralysis", yet another round of controversy has erupted over scientific studies related to wildfire prevention and salvage logging on Western forestlands.  Once again, ground zero is the site of the Biscuit Fire in Oregon but the ramifications, as the region heads into another fire season, are far and wide, extending to millions of acres of public land and the edges of cities where millions of people live.  In this commentary from Alison Berry and Jane S. Shaw of the Property and Environment Research Center (PERC) in Bozeman,  it is argued that a "one size fits all" management protocol for confronting wildfire risk is a bad idea for the Forest Service.  They also point out an example of  what they suggest is suppression of scientific dissent.  PERC, best known as a public policy thinktank that promotes market-based solutions to public lands over regulation, has drawn criticism over the years from mainstream environmentalists.  Among those who have applied PERC's reasoning over the years to their own thinking are former Interior Secretaries James Watt and Gale Norton, current Assistant Interior Secretary Lynn Scarlett and other environmental policy advisors close to President George W. Bush.  However, in this instance, with this essay, it would appear that PERC and conservationists share much in common.Salvage redirects here.

The one downside of a salvage grocery store is its not a one-stop-shop. Unlike a conventional grocery store, which stocks the same items each week, salvage stores wont have everything on your grocery list and their inventory is constantly changing.
You might find a great deal on grass-fed butter one week, and organic blueberries or super cheap kombucha the next, but dont expect to ever find the same thing twice.
